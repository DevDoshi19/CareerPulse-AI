## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CareerPulse seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Do Not Open a Public Issue
Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the application and its users at risk before a fix is available.

### 2. How to Report
Please report the vulnerability by contacting the project maintainer directly via email (or the contact method listed in your GitHub profile).

In your report, please include:
* A description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any relevant screenshots or logs.

### 3. Response Timeline
We will try to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will keep you updated on the progress of a fix.

### 4. API Key Safety
This project uses Google Gemini API keys.
* **For Users:** Do not share your personal API keys in screenshots or public forums.
* **For Contributors:** Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental key leakage.
